This port allows server admins to disable the end in Minecraft Fabric.
`/gamerule doDisableEnd <true|false>`

Because this Mod:
https://github.com/ArcticWarmth/DisableEnd
is for MC Version 1.20 & 1.20.1 and not for 1.20.4 i ported it and made some modifactions so it does not need the owo lib anymore.

This mod is server side and only requires fabric api
